# Reactivities

My take on the project of the ["Complete guide to building an app with .Net Core and React" Udemy course](https://www.udemy.com/course/complete-guide-to-building-an-app-with-net-core-and-react/).

First commit was at the end of section 8.

**Differences from the original project of the instructor:**
- Usage of React Router v6 instead of v5.

# How to run?

**Server**: run `dotnet run` or `dotnet watch` in the `API` directory
(need to have .NET 5/6 installed).

**Client**: run `npm start` in the `client-app` directory, after running `npm i` to install the client dependencies
(need to have `node` and `npm` installed).
